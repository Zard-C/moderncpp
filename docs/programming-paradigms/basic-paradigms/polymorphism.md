# Polymorphism

!!! note "Polymorphism"

    [Object Oriented programming](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming) (OOP) is a programming
    paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. 
    It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), 
    which are used to create individual instances of objects. 

    One of the key features of class inheritance is that a pointer to a derived class is type-compatible with a pointer
    to its base class. [Polymorphism](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/polymorphism/) is the art of taking
    advantage of this simple but powerful and versatile feature.
