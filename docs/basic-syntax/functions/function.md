# Functions

!!! warning "About functions"

    These snippets are about the syntax for defining functions. They are *not* about how to achieve tasks with these 
    functions. The tasks are just placeholders and the C++ STL already provides much better alternatives for most of
    these [algorithms](../../algorithms-data-structures/algorithm/basic-algorithms.md).
