# Raw pointers

!!!note "Raw pointers"

    A pointer is a type of variable. It stores the address of an object in memory, and is used to access that object. 
    A raw pointer is a pointer whose lifetime isn't controlled by an encapsulating object, such as a smart pointer.

    Raw pointers might be dangerous. Try to avoid them.
