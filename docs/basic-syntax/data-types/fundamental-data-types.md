# Fundamental Data Types

!!!note "Fundamental Data Types"

    A fundamental or primitive type is a data type where the values that it can represent have a very simple nature
    (a number, a character or a truth-value); the primitive types are the most basic building blocks for any 
    programming language and are the base for more complex data types.
