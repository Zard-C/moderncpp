# Sorting

!!! hint
    
    The standard [algorithms](basic-algorithms.md) for sorting containers are `std::sort` and `std::stable_sort`.

    These snippets include extra functions describing how these tasks can be implemented with many other classic 
    sorting algorithms. They are mostly relevant for people studying sorting algorithms for the first time.
