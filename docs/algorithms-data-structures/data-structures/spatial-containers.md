# Spatial Containers

!!! note "Spatial Containers"

    Spatial container are an extension of sets and maps that allow us to order data according to multiple dimensions.
    This is particularly useful in games and graphical interfaces, where objects need to be mapped in space.
    The standard library does not include spatial containers so an external library needs to be used.
